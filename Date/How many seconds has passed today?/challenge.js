  Title:
    How many seconds has passed today?

  Description:
    Write a function getSecondsToday() that returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today.

    For instance, if now 10:00 am, and there was no daylight savings shift, then:

    getSecondsToday() == 36000 // (3600 * 10)
    
    The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of “today”.
