  Title:
    Calculate factorial

  Description:
    The factorial of a natural number is a number multiplied by "number minus one", then by "number minus two", and so on till 1. The factorial of n is denoted as n!

    We can write a definition of factorial like this:
    n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ...*1

    Values of factorials for different n:

    1! = 1
    2! = 2 * 1 = 2
    3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
    4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
    5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

    The task is to write a function factorial(n) that calculates n! using recursive calls.

    P.S. Hint: n! can be written as n * (n-1)! For instance: 3! = 3*2! = 3*2*1! = 6

  Example:
    console.log(factorial(4));
    // => 24
